I was following [this tutorial](http://www.masteringreactjs.com/2018/04/01/step-by-step-typescript-with-webpack-react-and-redux/) to get started on this repo.

It turns out that there's actually a lot more work involved here - updating
files from a previously written JavaScript TodoMVC example, which can be
found [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

Stay tuned for more.
